### Hi there 👋

My name is Gabriel Augusto a.k.a. "Patrola", I'm from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as PHP and React/React-Native Developer since 2019 and currently I'm a Co-Founder and CTO in a startup called [DomPixel](https://dompixel.com.br). I’m currently improving my knowledge in Laravel, React and React-Native and learning Vue.

In my free time I like to go to the (and watch) gym (🏋🏻‍♂️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to and enjoy a good beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
